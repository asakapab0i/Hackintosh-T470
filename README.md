# Hackintosh-T470
My own journey to MacOS (Hackintosh) 

This setup was derived from this repository. 
https://github.com/notthebee/t440p-hackintosh

There are few things to be done in this setup.
- Webcam
- Saving brightness settings on nvram.plist
- Broadcom WLan upgrade
- Intel SSD is not being detected

Credits to RehabMan and the rest of Hackintosh community especially tmx.
